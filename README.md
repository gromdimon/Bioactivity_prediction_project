# Bioprediction projectðŸ”®
This is project about predicting bioactivity of drugs, that bind to Beta Amyloid A4.
Particularly I will build a machine learning model using the ChEMBL bioactivity data.
The Project consist of different parts.

In Part 1 I performe Data Collection and Pre-Processing from the ChEMBL Database.

In Part 2, I performe Descriptor Calculation and Exploratory Data Analysis.

In Part 3, I calculate molecular descriptors, that are description of the substances in the dataset. Finally, I will convert this into a dataset for subsequent model, that will be built in Part 4.

In Part 4, I make a regression model of beta-amyloid inhibitors using the random forest algorithm.
