# Bioprediction project
This is project about predicting bioactivity of drugs, that bind to Beta Amyloid A4.
Particularly I will build a machine learning model using the ChEMBL bioactivity data.
The Project consist of different parts.

In Part 1 I performe Data Collection and Pre-Processing from the ChEMBL Database.
